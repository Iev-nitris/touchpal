#summary TouchPal overview.

= Introduction =
TouchPal is a simple application which can interact with flight simulators and other games providing touch based interfaces to game functions. 

It takes a simple xml configuration file to configure buttons and text and how they interact with the game. 

TouchPal is capable of interacting with other software either by direct network communication or sending keystrokes to the active window. 

A touch screen is not required but is highly recommended.
